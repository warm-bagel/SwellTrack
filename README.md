## Who are we?
We are a group of surfers that constantly argues over where we want to surf... Sound familiar?

I can't count how many times I have said 'It's the same swell as last time! Let's go to (insert secret spot here)! While my friend says it was the opposite and I was wrong.

I'd love to have a resource that definitively knows what the swell direction, size, tide, wind direction, etc. was every time I surf. We also are adding a quick 140 character journal for you to track your sessions. If you hear somewhere was good yesterday, take the note and always be able to refer back to what the swell direction was that day. You won't screw up next time. Understand and read swell reports, have fun, and be right when you pick a spot.

Obviously, it's an art & and science, but having the tools to help will make your art better and your science smarter.

Yours truly, the `SwellTrack` Team

If you are interested in collecting buoy & weather data in your locale, please hit us up and we will prioritize your location! We are working on a script to do them all at once, but for now we are manually adding buoys and locations.
